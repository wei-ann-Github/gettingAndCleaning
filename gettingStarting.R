## description
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        
        step 1: look at the data in the training and test set

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable 
for each activity and each subject.

Good luck!
  
Please upload the tidy data set created in step 5 of the instructions. 
Please upload your data set as a txt file created with write.table() using row.name=FALSE
(do not cut and paste a dataset directly into the text box, as this may cause errors saving your submission).

Please submit a link to a Github repo with the code for performing your analysis. 
The code should have a file run_analysis.R in the main directory that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in 
your working directory. The output should be the tidy data set you submitted for part 1. 

You should include a README.md in the repo describing how the script works and the code book describing the variables.

indicate all the variables and summaries you calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information
